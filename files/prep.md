What is a docker container?
* In simplest terms, docker containers consist of applications and all their dependencies.
* They share the kernel and system resources with other containers and run as isolated systems in the host operating system.
* The main aim of docker containers is to get rid of the infrastructure dependency while deploying and running applications. This means that any containerized application can run on any platform irrespective of the infrastructure being used beneath.
* Technically, they are just the runtime instances of docker images.
